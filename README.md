# Task Management System
Here you can see my own implementation of the website, that can help you and your team organize work!

I tried to make it simple and in the same time comfortable for use. You can create user and team, build your own task board, assign people to different tasks. There are tags, which help you find similar tasks faster and buttons to switch between projects.
